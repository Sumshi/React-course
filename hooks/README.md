React Hooks, plainly put, are functions that let us manage the internal state of components and handle post-rendering side effects directly from our function components. Using Hooks, we can determine what we want to show the users by declaring how our user interface should look based on the state.

```
useState: Returns the current state of the component and its setter function
When we call the useState() function, it returns an array with two values:
The current state: The current value of this state.
The state setter: A function that we can use to update the value of this state.
```
