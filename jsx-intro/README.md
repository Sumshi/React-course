<h3>What is JSX in React</h3>
<P>JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It was written to be used with React. JSX code looks a lot like HTML.</P>
<p>JSX is not valid JavaScript. Web browsers canâ€™t read it</p>

```
Here are some of jsx elements:
<h1>Hello world</h1>
```

<p>This JSX element looks exactly like HTML! The only noticeable difference is that you would find it in a JavaScript file, instead of in an HTML file.</p>

```
several jsx elements:
const navBar = <nav>I am a nav bar</nav>;
```

<p>A JSX attribute is written using HTML-like syntax: a name, followed by an equals sign, followed by a value. The value should be wrapped in quotes, like this:</p>
```
const title = <h1 id='title'>Introduction to React.js: Part I</h1>;
const panda = <img src='images/panda.jpg' alt='panda' width='500px' height='500px'>;
```

```

```
